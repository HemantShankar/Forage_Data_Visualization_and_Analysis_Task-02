# Forage_Data_Visualization_and_Analysis_Task-02
It is a task that i completed while i was working on forage platform. They had two taks that were going to give me the real life experience of data analysis and visualization at
Tata IQ. It is the 2nd task and In this task, I was given an another dataset of a retail store and i had to answer four question by giving suitable visualization for them.
These visualizations were subjected towards the growth and expansion of the retail store.
So, I performed data cleaning, Feature Engineering and EDA on the dataset and made the data fit for visualization. Then, I used tableau for showing the visualizations of the
Answers.
